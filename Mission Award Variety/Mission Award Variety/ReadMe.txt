1.1.0 also adds translations for all the default languages. I did my best using Google Translate, but if you have more appropriate translations send them my way and I'll hook it up.

FAQ

Q: I have an idea for an award, can you add it to your mod?
A: Maybe, depending on how interesting it is and how easy it is to track.

Q: How is luck calculated?
A: Whenever a soldier makes a successful shot, (100 - ChanceToHit) is added to their luck value. Whenever they dodge enemy fire, ChanceToHit is added to their luck value.

Q: How come I haven't seen some of these awards?
The screen can only fit 8 awards at a time and the ones you see are randomized. Also, some categories may not have a winner and will not be shown.

Q: What does it mean to "turtle"?
Turtling means you're playing defensively, ie. overwatching or hunkering down like a turtle hiding in its shell.

Q: What are the configuration options?
In XComMissionAwardVariety.ini, you can change the minimum amount of turtling required to be eligible for the turtle award and you can also change the minimum rank required to be considered Too Old For This $#!@.

Q: Any compatibility issues?
A: Does not override any classes so it should work with any mod except for those that override UIDropShipBriefing_MissionEnd such as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=638033072]Nice DropShip (De)Briefing[/url]. I will look into compatbility with this mod for the next update.
