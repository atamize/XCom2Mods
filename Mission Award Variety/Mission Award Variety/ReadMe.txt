FAQ
Q: I have an idea for an award, can you add it to your mod?
A: Maybe, depending on how interesting it is and how easy it is to track.

Q: How is luck calculated?
A: Whenever a soldier makes a successful shot, (100 - ChanceToHit) is added to their luck value. Whenever they dodge enemy fire, ChanceToHit is added to their luck value.

Q: How come I haven't seen some of these awards?
The screen can only fit 8 awards at a time and the ones you see are randomized. Also, some categories may not have a winner and will not be shown.

Q: What does it mean to "turtle"?
A: Turtling means you're playing defensively, ie. overwatching or hunkering down like a turtle hiding in its shell.

Q: Any compatibility issues?
A: Does not override any classes so it should work with any mod except for those that override UIDropShipBriefing_MissionEnd such as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=638033072]Nice DropShip (De)Briefing[/url]. There is support planned for compatibility with this mod so please stay tuned.
