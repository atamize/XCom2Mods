FAQ

Q: I have an idea for an award, can you add it to your mod?
A: Maybe, depending on how interesting it is and how easy it is to track.

Q: How is luck calculated?
A: Whenever a soldier makes a successful shot, (100 - ChanceToHit) is added to their luck value.
Whenever they dodge enemy fire, ChanceToHit is added to their luck value.

Q: Can I replace the lame awards on the right instead of the lame stats on the left?
You sure can! XComMissionAwardVariety.ini contains a bool bOverrideRightList which you can modify to replace
either the left list ('Successful Shot Percentage') or right list ('Dealt Most Damage') depending on which
stats you feel are more worthless.

Q: Any compatibility issues?
A: Does not override any classes so it should work with any mod except for those that override
UIDropShipBriefing_MissionEnd such as Nice DropShip (De)Briefing.


Thanks to Kosmo for the Lifetime Stats mod whose code was very helpful in setting this up.
